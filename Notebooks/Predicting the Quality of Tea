I created a data set on my own which i'm going to use in this project.
it determines the quality of tea based on previous inputs.
We first start by collecting the required data. Clean it: removing unwanted rows and columns
in the MS Excel. Then we convert the format into a CSV. This CSV file is uploaded to our
Jupyter Notebook where we load this dataset.
We visualize this dataset using different graphs offered to us by Matplotlib and Seaborn in
Pandas like the box plot, histogram and the scatter matrix.
The dataset is then split into a training set and testing set. We train the training set to predict
different types of tea. This will be our machine learning model. This model is then tested on
what is known as the testing set. The dataset splitting ratio is usually 4:1 and we have used
that.
Since our project is a classification problem, we need to use one of the classification
algorithms out of many. To choose the best algorithm for our project, we test the accuracy of
each algorithm in relation to our project. We find that Linear Discriminant Analysis gives us
the maximum accuracy of 95%.
